# Where have all the SPA templates gone?

They are now in the [ASP.NET templating](https://github.com/aspnet/templating) repo.

This is so that all the ASP.NET templates (both SPA and non-SPA) can be built, tested, and packaged from a single location and always included automatically in future SDK builds.

### What about issues and pull requests?

If you have issues or comments about the SPA templates, please continue to post them [here in this repo](https://github.com/aspnet/JavaScriptServices/issues), because then you will reach a more relevant group of contributors than if you posted to `aspnet/templating`.

If you want to submit a pull request on the SPA templates, then of course you will neeed to submit that to the `aspnet/templating` repo, because that's where the code is now. But before doing so it's always a good idea to [post an issue on this repo](https://github.com/aspnet/JavaScriptServices/issues) describing what you want to do, so we can discuss whether or not such a PR would be accepted.
